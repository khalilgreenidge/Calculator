# Calculator
This repository contains a project for creating a basic CLI-based calculator from scratch. This project was actually an assignment on which was developed strictly using Java without using any libraries. The grade I received for this assignment was 100%. Although a calculator may seem as simple as adding 2 + 2 = 4, the difficult part is evaluating multiple operands and operators for an expression. Unless you us a library, computers find it difficult using BODMAS, which leads to the wrong answer being printed on the screen. This problem was solved using the Shunting-Yard Algorithm invented by Edsger W. Dijkstra. It also features a cool "history" feature that saves your calculations.
